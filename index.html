                <p>THE INDIAN SUMMIT is not just a conference designed to bring together delegates from 
                  around the country to engage in debates on ongoing and emerging issues, this conference uniquely aims 
                  to celebrate and revive INDIAN CULTURE in an era where globalization, epitomized by the 
                  "McDonaldization" phenomenon, has led to the diminishing of our rich cultural heritage.  </p>
                <p>Latterly, there's an urgent need to reconnect with our roots and promote our cultural. The Indian Summit 
                  addresses this need by fostering a platform where the essence of Indian culture is at the forefront. The 
                  theme for this year, "THE CULTURE SAYS EVERYTHING?", encapsulates our vision to enrich and 
                  promote cultural awareness through various engaging activities.</p>
                <p>With a mission in confluence with the GREEN INITIATIVE, the Indian Summit shall be a completely 
                  ZERO PLASTIC event, promoting green initiatives and showcasing eco-friendly practices. Our 
                  dedication to the environment underscores our belief that cultural preservation and environmental 
                  stewardship go hand in hand.  </p>
                <p>The summit will feature a diverse range of activities designed to inspire confidence in emerging minds 
                  and encourage public speaking ranging from the evergreen heated debates to lightening activities. This 
                  initiative not only aims to contribute to nation-building through cultural preservation and enhancement 
                  but also ensuring that emerging carries forward the legacy of Indian culture with renewed vigor. </p>
              
                <p>Join us at the Indian Summit, where we celebrate the past, present, and future of Indian culture and 
                  prove that “YES, THE CULTURE SAYS EVERYTHING”…</p>
